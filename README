There is a new vim plugin OmniCppComplete at:
http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1520
It works better, is easier to setup and is also better maintained, so please use that.

IMPORTANT: I will NOT maintain icomplete in future anymore, if you are interested in improving it, please tell me, and you can take over maintainership.
