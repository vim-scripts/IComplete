			IComplete - A code completion system

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
                        
IComplete expects the exuberant-ctags program to be installed as ctags somewhere in you path.
Some distributions like Gentoo or Mandrake install it as exuberant-ctags, if this is true in your case, run the ./configure command like this: 
    # ./configure CTAGS_CMD=exuberant-ctags

IComplete also copies the vim script to /usr/share/vim/...
If you have vim installed in /usr/local/share/vim instead try this command:
    # ./configure --datadir=/usr/local/share

If you want to have IComplete installed in /usr instead of /usr/local use:
    # ./configure --prefix=/usr

Other options are explained in:
	# ./configure --help


Now just run the normal commands: 
    # ./configure <options>
    # make
    # su
    $ make install
